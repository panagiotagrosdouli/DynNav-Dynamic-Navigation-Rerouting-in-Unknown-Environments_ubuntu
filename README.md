# Dynamic Navigation and Uncertainty-Aware Replanning in Unknown Environments

This repository presents a full research-oriented pipeline for **autonomous robotic navigation in unknown environments under sensing and localization uncertainty**. The project integrates **ROS 2, Visual Odometry (VO), SLAM-based mapping, coverage planning, information gain exploration, uncertainty-aware replanning, and learned A* heuristics**, with extensive **statistical validation and ablation studies**.

The work was developed as an individual research project at the **School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Democritus University of Thrace (D.U.Th.)**.

## 1. Research Problem

Autonomous navigation in unknown environments is fundamentally limited by:

* **Sensor uncertainty** (especially visual odometry drift),
* **Incomplete maps** during exploration,
* **Dynamic obstacles and replanning requirements**,
* **Trade-offs between optimality, coverage, safety, and computational cost**.

Classical global planners (A*, RRT*) assume reliable state estimation and static cost maps. However, in realistic robotic scenarios, **pose drift, feature sparsity, and tracking failures directly affect planning quality**. This project studies how navigation performance can be improved by **explicitly modeling uncertainty and learning data-driven heuristics for search-based planning**.

## 2. Main Contributions

The main scientific contributions of this project are:

* **Uncertainty-aware coverage planning** using VO-derived feature density and pose uncertainty.
* **Drift-weighted dynamic replanning** based on a learned priority field.
* **Information Gain (IG) and Next-Best-View (NBV) exploration** under uncertainty.
* **Learned neural heuristic for A*** to reduce node expansions and planning time.
* **Multi-objective navigation** combining entropy, coverage, path length, and safety.
* **Statistical validation** with benchmark comparisons, ablation studies, and t-tests.
* **Full ROS 2 and Gazebo integration** using TurtleBot3 simulation.
